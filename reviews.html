    <p>Villa Strmo is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">a very special place</span> and we felt incredibly relaxed all ten days.</p>
    <p>We were therd with nine adults and a small child (4) and enjoyed every minute.</p>
    <p>The house is furnished with everything you need and is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">right on the sea.</span> The </p>
    <p>rooms are modern, all have their own bathrooms and the beds and blankets</p>
    <p>are great. There are two kitchens and the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">outdoor kitchen</span> is a dream. The </p>
    <p>garden, the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">chill areas</span>c and the jacuzzi are also great and everyone has found </p>
    <p>their place. We found and used many leisure activities for sea and garden.</p>
    <p>Thanks for the easel and the various painting utensils! <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">Altogether successful</span> </p>
    <p>and if we come back into the corner then its with Goran.</p>

    <p>An absolute dream villa! We hardly left the villa as it <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">really offers everything</span> your</p>
    <p>heart desires! The outdoor kitchen in particular is really fantastic. The whirlpool </p>
    <p>even has a music function! Goran and Viktor are super personable and were</p>
    <p>always available and available with advice and action. As a surprise there was a </p>
    <p>stand-up paddle for the new season! Although we already had high expectations</p>
    <p>based on the pictures, these <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">expectations were exceeded</span> on site.</p>

    <p>Wow! What an incredible house with a fantastic location. Very thankful to.</p>
    <p>find this house for our stay! Viktor and his father were great hosts. The </p>
    <p>contact prior to <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">our stay was informative and helpful</span>, Viktor answered any</p>
    <p>questions we had. On the day of arrival we were met a short drive away </p>
    <p>from the house then followed Viktor and his father to the house (the roads</p>
    <p>are narrow and steep hills at times). At the house Viktor gave us a tour. We </p>
    <p>then sat in the garden all together and Viktor offered us a  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">welcome drink</span></p>
    <p>and gave us some house and local tips/information. Throughout our stay</p>
    <p>Viktor was contactable and  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">very quick to reply</span> when we had any </p>
    <p>questions. A lovely, memorable stay for our group (6 adults, 2 children and</p>
    <p>a baby) and we  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">hope to visit again.</span> With sincere thanks!</p>

    <p>Dream house by the sea!</p>
    <p>We were welcomed very warmly by Viktor, owners son, who invited us to Villa Strmo.</p>
    <p>Only a few kilometers from Trogir, you can reach this beautiful, <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">completely newly</span> </p>
    <p><span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">renovated</span> Villa via a narrow steep road. Viktor took a lot of time and showed us </p>
    <p>everything in and around the house. For example, the service from the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">great jacuzzi</span></p>
    <p>which we enjoyed every day.</p>
    <p>The villa actually exceeded our expectations! The photos in advance were really nice, </p>
    <p>but this view from the garden to the sea was overwhelming. Garden door up </p>
    <p>and into the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">crystal clear sea.</span> I A metal guide makes it very easy to get into the water.</p>
    <p>Only a few meters away you can reach a beach, which is very suitable for small </p>
    <p>children.</p>
    <p>Villa has 5 very <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">beautiful rooms each with its own bathroom.</span> The house is very</p>
    <p>lovingly furnished and has a special flair with a feel good factor. In the garden there is </p>
    <p>the outdoor kitchen, equipped with everything you can imagine (induction cooker, </p>
    <p>oven, dishwasher, large refrigerators, dishes, glasses...). The <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">large garden</span> has many</p>
    <p>different places where you can sit together, but also be undisturbed. Sun beds,</p>
    <p>porch swing, different lovely lounges. We all <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">felt completely comfortable</span> this week </p>
    <p>and will definitely be back.</p>
    <p>Again, our warmest thanks to Viktor, Goran and Lea for the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">very warm hospitality</span>.</p>
    <p>We look forward to a reunion.</p>

    <p>Goran's home was <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">even better than the pictures.</span> The check in was easy and the</p>
    <p>home was walking distance to the beach, downtown, and the stadium. Goran even</p>
    <p>allowed us a late check out the following day since our plane didn't leave until the</p>
    <p>afternoon. Thanks so much for <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">a great stay!</span></p>
